# 5 Sequence Of Play

- Turn 0
- Phase I – TORA, TORA, TORA: All JA Aircraft Carrier units with the Set-Up Code [H] perform one round of Airstrike Combat (9.1.1) against U.S. Naval units in the Hawaiian Islands OZ, using the 31+ column on the Combat Results Chart.
- Phase II – Air Raid Malaysia: The JA LBA unit based in the Indochina OZ performs one round of Airstrike Combat against British Naval units in the Singapore OZ, using the [6-7] column on the Combat Results Chart.
- Phase III – A Day of Infamy: After applying all losses from both Phase I and II, all Japanese Naval units with the Set-Up Code [H] are placed in the Japan OZ, with their Ready side up
- Phase IV – The Sleeping Giant Awakens: Place U.S. Naval units with the Set-Up Code [PH] in the Hawaiian Islands OZ.
- Phase V – Victory Fever: Turn Zero (0) is now complete, but no Victory Points are calculated this Turn.

Turn 1 ot 5
- Reinforcements Phase (6.0): Both players place their Reinforcements from the Turn Track, to their indicated OZs. 
- Resource Card Draw Phase (7.0): Both players now draw the appropriate number of Resource Cards (RCs).
- Strategy Execution Phase (8.0): 
  - Determine Initiative
  - Execute Strategy Rounds, including Combat (9.0) as needed, then
  - Repeat until the Strategy Phase ends.
- Supply Phase (10.0):
  - Japanese Player checks for Isolation,
  - Allied Player checks for Isolation,
  - Japanese Player conducts Port Invasions,
  - Allied Player conducts Port Invasions,
  - Japanese Player Redeployment and Return to Port
  - Allied Player Redeployment and Return to Port,
  - Japanese Player Resupply of Naval Units, then
  - Allied Player Resupply of Naval Units.
- Victory Phase (11.0): 
  - Japanese Victory Point Calculation,
  - Allied Victory Point Calculation,
  - Adjust Victory Point Marker,
  - Determine if an Automatic Victory occurs, then
  - Advance the Turn Marker. If this is the last Turn (Turn 5), Victory is now determined.


# 6 Reinforcements Phase

- AP may place any Allied LBA units (both Repaired or Reinforcement) in either the West Coast OZ or Madagascar OZ.
- ALL Reinforcement and Repaired units are placed Ready side up.
- Japanese units may NEVER be placed in the Madagascar OZ or West Coast OZ
## 6.1 Appearence of Reinforcements

### 6.1.1 JA Reinforcements/Repaired Units

Place in JA OZ

### 6.1.1 JA Reinforcements Units

Place in West Coast OZ

### 6.1.1 US Repaired Units

Place in JA OZ

### 6.1.1 UK Reinforcements/Repaired Units

Place in Madagascar OZ

### 6.1.1 AU Reinforcements/Repaired Units

Place in AU OZ

### 6.1.6 Reinforcements and Enemy-Occupied Ports

If, at the beginning of the Reinforcements Phase, an OZ Port that has scheduled Reinforcements arriving but is under enemy control, those Reinforcements cannot enter the game this Turn. These units will appear during the Reinforcements Phase on the next Turn that the applicable OZ Port is back under friendly control.

### 6.1.7 Repaired Units and Enemy-Occupied Ports

Any Naval units scheduled to complete Repairs this Turn but are due to appear in a Port that is under enemy control, are immediately destroyed and removed from the game. All units undergoing Repair should be removed from the game at the moment they are occupied (no matter the Turn they are due to arrive), but this rule is here as a reminder.

Note that the only exception is Australia; if the Australia OZ is occupied by the Japanese and Australian Naval or LBA units are damaged in combat, repairs of Australian units are made in the West Coast OZ, at least until the Australia OZ is liberated (placed back under Allied control).

## 6.2 Check For British Naval Unit Withdrawal

The British were heavily engaged back in Europe against the German Kriegsmarine; as a result, some British Naval units are withdrawn to Europe during the game. These Naval units have a Set-Up Code with two numbers (e.g., [2-4]). The first number is the Turn the unit appears as a Reinforcement, while the second number is the Turn it must be withdrawn. If the Allied Player has any Naval units that fit this description, they must be withdrawn from the game at this time. Note that any British ships that are damaged and will not return until after the Turn they are to withdraw, are removed from the game during the Reinforcement Phase in which their repairs are completed. A British ship that is damaged past the Turn it is withdrawn, counts as being withdrawn
for this rule; in other words, the Allied Player does not have to withdraw another similar Naval unit.

### 6.2.1 British Ship Sunk Before Withdrawal

If a British Naval unit is slated to be withdrawn, but is sunk before it is withdrawn, the Allied Player DOES NOT have to withdraw another similar ship in its place

- Move some or all to a port under their control

### 8.9.3 Move LBA Units (Redeployment)

- Move from current OZ to different OZ using Redeployment [10.4](10.4)

## 8.10 Naval Movement

Normal Naval Movement is covered here

### 8.10.1 Normal Movement

TBD

- To move Naval units, the controlling player chooses an OZ where he has Naval units on their Ready side, and then forms one group. This group can have one or more Naval units (and only Naval units) in it; the player is not required to choose all his Naval units in an OZ.

This group is then moved from OZ to OZ, spending Movement Points (see below) as it moves, to its destination OZ, along connecting Sea Routes (SRs). 

When you choose Normal Movement, you can only form ONE group and have ONE destination OZ; you cannot split moving Naval units into other groups, nor can you ‘drop off ’ Naval units along the way, so they end up in different OZs. 

A group sticks together from formation to the destination OZ.

Moving from one OZ to another along one SR costs one Movement Point (MP).

Nav Points: To properly represent the vast distances involved in the Pacific Ocean, some Sea Routes have a Nav Point (a white dot) along them. These Nav Points require the player moving a Naval group from one OZ to another OZ along an SR with a Nav Point to spend TWO Movement Points instead of one.

Movement Points: This is equal to the slowest Movement Speed value in the group. This number is ‘spent’ as the player moves his group from OZ to OZ (see above). The full amount of Movement Points does not need to be spent; however, if the player wishes to conduct combat in the destination OZ, having several ‘spare’ Movement Points will allow him to attack for more Combat Rounds (9.0)

Ending Movement: Naval units must end movement when:
• The Movement Point allowance for the slowest ship in the group is reached, OR
• The group enters an OZ with enemy Naval and/or LBA unit(s).

Moving a group into an enemy-occupied OZ means the group must stop moving AND resolve Combat (9.0). If Naval units that were moving still have MPs left, the remaining MPs affect the length of Combat (9.1). If there are enemy Aircraft Carriers or (in the case of the Japanese Player) Allied LBA in the OZ that units are moving into, it could trigger a Reaction Movement (8.12). 

Naval units can move freely through OZs with an enemy Control marker on them, but has no enemy units present; in this case, leave the control marker alone.

- Once a group has completed movement, whether ending in an OZ that is empty or occupied by enemy Naval and/or LBA units, the moving Naval units are immediately flipped over to their Ops Complete side, even before Combat is resolved.

- Restricted Sea Route cannot be used by either player until the Allied Player uses an RC to open it 

## 8.11 LBA Movement

- May also be moved in Supply Phase Redeployment [10.4](10.4)
- See 8.9.3

## 8.12 Reaction Movement

- Active Players Naval unit(s) move into OZ where Non-active Player has Ready Carrier(s)
- Active JP moves Naval unit(s) into OZ where Non-active AP has LBA present (ready or complete)
- Can perform one of the following reactions
  - Emergency evacuation
    - All units (and LBA) belonging to Non-active player in OZ can retreat
    - Active player Naval unit(s) with MPs available can keep moving and pursue if desired
    - see 9.5 Retreating
  - Counter attack
    - Non-active Players ready Naval unit(s) within range (MP - 1 >= range to OZ) may move to OZ to counter attack
    - Flip attacking Naval unit(s) to complete state

# 9 Combat

- JP and AP Naval and/or LBA unit(s) are in the same OZ
- Active Player is Attacker, Non-active Player is Defender
- All units take part whether Ready or Complete

### 9.0.1 Use Of RC In Combat
- Can use any number of RCs, also no limit on each combat round, but each player can only play one RC at a time
- Cannot use Strategic Event RCs
- JP selects and plays one RC first followed by AP playing one RC

### 9.0.2 LBA In Combat
- Only be moved by Redeployment [10.4](10.4)
- Can only initiate combat by the following events
  - End of battleship era (JP)
  - George C Kennedy (AP)
  - T Force (JP)
  - Skip Bombing (AP)

## 9.1 Rounds of Combat

- Number of rounds = Movement left + 1
- On a per unit basis or use lease number of rounds ???

### 9.1.1 Airstrike Combat

- LBA or Carrier

### 9.1.2 Surface Combat

- If attacker decides not to conduct, round ends
- Use gunnery

### 9.1.3 Continue or End Combat

- end if defender eliminated, attacker wins
- can continue if: attacker has remaining MPs and defender choose not to retreat
- if attacker choose not to continue, attacker retreats

## 9.2 Combat Resolution

### 9.2.1 Hit Determination

- Add the total attacking Strength values of all  units in the Combat and locate the Column on  the Combat Results Chart that reflects that total. 
- For Airstrike Combat, add up only the Airstrike Strength of units;
- for Surface Combat, add up only the Gunnery Strength of units

### 9.2.2 Airstrike Modifiers

- During Airstrike Combat, adjust the Column used as follows (there are no column shifts during Surface Combat)
- Note that the modifiers below are cumulative.
- Adjustments by Resource Cards (RCs): Use text on the Card
- The enemy has more Aircraft Carriers in this Combat Round: Shift one column to the left.
- The enemy has LBA in this Combat Round: Shift one column to the left.
- When adjusting the hit columns, if the adjustment shifts the column to the left of the 1 Attack Strength Column outside the chart, the attack scores no 
hits.
- If the adjustment shifts the column to the right of the 31+ Attack Strength Column, use the 31+ column to determine hits.
- As mentioned, if there are column shifts to both the left and right, you apply the sum of the column shifts. 

### 9.2.3 Number Of Hits

Roll 1d6 and cross-reference the result with the appropriate column on the Combat Results Chart to determine the number of hits made

### 9.2.4 Hit Allocation

Airstrike Hits
- Attacker allocate hits (9.2.5 para 3)
- The Attacker can select one enemy Naval or LBA unit for each hit scored. 
- If more than one hit is scored, each targeted Naval and LBA unit must have one hit allocated to it, before additional hits can be added to other units
  - e.g. you have 6 hits on 3 naval and 1 LBA units, first 4 hits are on all 4 unit, next 2 hits, one is on Naval the other is LBA

Surface Hits
- Defender allocate hits (9.2.5 para 3)
- The Defender selects which one of his Naval units is hit. Just like with Airstrike Hits, each Naval unit targeted must have one hit allocated to it before a second hit can be allocated to any Naval unit

Hits on LBA
- You can allocate hits to LBA units ONLY during Airstrike Combat (exception: The Bombardment RC (#J07)). 
- Damage to LBA units is not the same as for Naval units; if one hit is scored, an LBA unit reappears the next Turn; if two hits are scored, the LBA unit reappears in two Turns; and so on. If the reappearance Turn exceeds the last Turn of the game, the unit is removed from game. Once damage is fully allocated, apply the damage results as appropriate to the affected LBA unit(s)

### 9.2.5 Damage

- Roll 1d6 for each hit to an enemy Naval unit and add up the total.
- If total > Naval unit’s Defense Strength (DS), the unit is sunk/destroyed and is permanently removed from the game. 

- If total <= unit’s DS, the unit is damaged and reappears in the same amount of Turns as the result of the die roll(s)  total. Place damaged units on the Turn space on the map corresponding with when they reappear. e.g. if 1 is rolled then it appears on the next turn

- If the damage result would place it in a Turn after Turn 5, the unit is instead removed from the game.

- If there are more hits to distribute than units to receive the hits, they must be allocated as uniformly as possible.

- Heavily Armored Ships: EACH hit die roll is reduced by one (-1). If die roll is 1, it becomes zero (0), and the Naval unit is not damaged. However, if a six (6) is rolled, the Naval unit is destroyed, regardless of armor.

LBA Unit Hits: An LBA unit can ONLY be hit during Airstrike Combat, with the exception of the Japanese Resource Card Bombardment (#J07). This RC lets you allocate hits to LBAs during Surface Combat (but ONLY when this RC is In play), so you could technically move a Naval unit group with no Aircraft Carriers to an OZ with enemy LBA without worry.

## 9.3 Combat Resolution

- Attacker resolves combat followed by defender
- Results are simultaneous and losses applied at same time
- some RC events can change sequence of combat resolution

## 9.4 Determine Combat Winner

- if only attacker remains, due to defender elimination or retreat, attacker wins
- attacker units can remain in OZ on complete state or retreat

## 9.5 Retreating

### 9.5.1 Defender Retreat
  - Can choose to retreat before Combat round begins
  - After resolution of combat at 9.1.1 or 9.2.2

### 9.5.2 Attacker Retreat
  - Must retreat if unable to eliminate all Defenders after ALL combat rounds
  - After resolution of combat at 9.1.1 or 9.2.2


### 9.5.3 Retreat Results
  - must retreat ALL units in OZ
  - same as 10.4 Return to Port
    - move to any ports under control
    - NO range limits
    - cannot move through OZ controlled by enemy or OZ in which enemy units are present
      - if not possible use Redeploy of Isolated Units 10.4

- After Combat Round
  - Attacker and/or Defender can choose to retreat
  - Attacher decides first (9.1.2)
  - Defender Retreats
    - LBA removed from map and become next turns reinforcements
    - Unit(s) are NOT flipped to complete state
    - Attacker wins (can opt to retreat)
  - Attacker Retreats
    - See Retreat Results

# 10 Supply Phase

### 10.1 Check Isolation

Japanese Naval and LBA not at Port under friendly control
  && cannot trace a route back to Port under friendly control = Isolated
- Naval: flip to ops complete and redeploy to nearest Port under friendly control
- LBA removed from map and become next turns reinforcement

### 10.2 Port Combat Invasion

20 whole aistrike and/or gunnery points = 1 Ground Strength
1 RC = 1 Ground Strength
Ground Strength >= VP = capture (place control marker)
only LBA and/or RC cannot capture

### 10.2.1 Requirements to Capture a Port

The capturing player MUST have Naval units present in the OZ of the Port they want to capture; a Port cannot be captured with only LBA units and/or RCs. 

## 10.3 How Major Ports Function

Major Ports: Japan OZ, Hawaii OZ, Australia OZ 
### 10.3.1 Captured Major Port

Japan not under Japanese control
- No reinforcements until under control, units under repairs are destroyed and removed from game

Australia, Hawaii
- repaired units are destroyed
- reinforcements arrive in US west coast OZ instead

## 10.4 Redeployment and Return to Port

Redeployment
- LBA move to OZ under their control or OZ with friendly Naval units (TOREMOVE DUPLICATE)
- No need to trace through connecting sea routes
- move only 1 LBA in Strategy Phase (each time you do a redeploy)
- during redeployment phase of Supply Phase, can move all LBA on the map
- From [8.9.3](8.9.3)
  - No distance limit
  - destination OZ, if Base, can only support one LBA; an OZ that already has an LBA present cannot have another one moved there.
  - destination OZ, if Port, can have unlimited LBA
  - The destination OZ MUST be friendly-controlled  OR have friendly Naval units present
- who first ???

Return to Port

- Naval units that are on either their Ready or Ops Complete side, can move to a Port under that player’s control, without any distance limitations. 
- However, you cannot move them through an OZ under your opponent’s control or through an OZ where enemy ships are located. In addition, you cannot use the Return to Port action to move your Naval units to a Base. 
- Naval units that are so moved do NOT flip sides; units on their Ready side remain on their Ready side, and units on their Ops Complete side remain on that side, when they are Returning to Port.
- During the Strategy Phase, each time you Return to Port, you can only move a group of Naval units from one OZ to another OZ; however, during the 
Return to Port sub-phase of the Supply Phase, you can move all your Naval units on the map to any Ports you control.
- LBA that redeploy do not need to use a Sea Route; they can move from any OZ to any OZ that is friendly-controlled, or any OZ that has friendly Naval units present (e.g., an LBA at the West Coast OZ can be moved to Australia or Ceylon).
- Returning to Port is a player’s choice and Is NOT mandatory. Capital ships that moved to a Base and were Ops Complete can stay at the Base at their 
current status. They don’t have to be returned to a Port, but if you want to flip them again to their Ready side, they must be returned to a Port.
- When deciding which Port to which your Naval units can return, you need to consider Readying Naval Units in Port (10.5). 

## 10.5 Readying Units in Port

- All Japanese Naval units in the Japan OZ, U.S. Naval units in the Hawaiian Islands OZ or the US West Coast OZ, British Naval units in the Ceylon OZ or Madagascar OZ, and Australian Naval units in the Australia OZ, that are on their Ops Complete side, are immediately flipped to their Ready side. These Ports are easily identified by the flag printed on them. 
- In any other Ports other than the ones mentioned above, you can discard one Resource Card to flip all Naval units in that OZ from their Ops Complete side to their Ready side
- In Bases, you can discard one Resource Card to flip all Non-Capital Ships on their Ops Complete side in that OZ to their Ready side. There is no 
need to have control of the Base.
- Capital ships can only be turned to their Ready sides at a Port. 
- Note that LBA units do not have an Ops Complete side

# 11 Victory

You can have units in a Port but not have enough Ground Strength to take control of it. In that case, you place a Base marker.

- Controlled Port VP diff, move winner VP up by diff
- Controlled Port and Base number diff, player with more bases gain 1 additional VP
- Also gain VP from RC events

## 11.1 Automatic Victory

### 11.1.1 Capturing Japan

Self explanatory

### 11.1.2 End of Turn 4

- JP have 5 or more VP = JP victory
- AP have 1 or more VP = AP victory

### 11.3.3 End of Turn 5

- AP have 5 or mor = AP victory
- AP has 4 or less = JP victory

# 12 Control

Each OZ on the map can by controlled by the Japanese Player, the Allied Player, or neither player. Port and Base Control markers (4.2) are used to show which player controls which OZs; Bases that neither player controls are left without a Control marker. There is a difference in control of an OZ as a Base and a Port; read the below sections carefully

## 12.1 Air Superiority Zones

- A player’s LBA unit(s) project air power into adjacent OZs (sea route MUST be OPEN), in what is called Air Superiority Zones

- These Air Superiority Zones can, depending on circumstances, exert control over adjacent Base OZs, or turn enemy-controlled Ports that are adjacent into a friendly-controlled Base.

- Bases that lie within two OZs, regardless of distance to Ports under their opponent’s control, do not fall under the Air Superiority Zone. Two OZs mean two different OZs that one within one OZ and not two MPs. Bases that fall within a player’s Air Superiority Zone come under their control. 

- Air Superiority Zone may NOT extend over a Sea Route that has a Nav Point (8.10);

## 12.2 Base Controlled By Naval unit(s)

- A Base where only one player has Naval unit(s) present comes under that player’s control. 
- However, this control is ‘canceled out’ if that OZ falls under an opponent’s Air Superiority Zone, in which case neither player controls that OZ. 

## 12.2 Base Controlled By LBA(s)

LBA unit(s) can control adjacent OZs if certain conditions are met. A player controls an adjacent Base OZ when It: 
A. Physically contains that player’s LBA unit(s), OR
B. Contains that player’s Naval units and is NOT adjacent to an OZ containing an opponent’s LBA unit(s), OR
C. Is adjacent to an OZ that (1) contains the player’s LBA unit(s), (2) does not contain their opponent’s Naval units, and (3) is not adjacent to an OZ containing an opponent’s LBA unit(s).

A Port controlled by your opponent is treated as a Base under your control if either (A) or (B) above are satisfied. Neither player can use it as a Port for any purpose in these cases (e.g. collection of VPs or Capital Ship resupply). To capture a Port, refer to 12.3, below


## 12.3 Port Control And Capture

A Port can NEVER be captured solely by an Air Superiority Zone; however, It CAN become a Base if 12.2 is satisfied. In this case, place one of your Base Control markers on top of the Port Control marker in that OZ to show this. An OZ like this is considered in all aspects as a Base and neither player may gain Victory Points from it.

Note: Projecting an Air Superiority Zone Into an enemy-controlled Port like this is an easy way to deny Victory Points to your enemy.

### 12.3.1 Ports With Base Control Markers

Note that when your opponent’s Port that has a Base under your control, and it falls within an Air Superiority Zone from your opponent from another adjacent OZ, AND you have no LBA of your own within that OZ, rule 12.2 and (B) applies, and you lose control of that Base; remove your Base Control marker from that OZ. If you still have Naval units in that OZ, place them on top of your opponent’s Port Control marker. Neither player has control at that point. If you don’t have Naval units at that Port, then 12.3.3 below applies and the Port immediately returns to your opponent’s control

### 12.3.2 Naval Units in an Opponents Port

- During the Port Invasion sub-phase of the Supply Phase, if your Naval units are located at your opponent’s Port, then the Port can be captured by you (10.2). Turn the Port Control marker over to your side and remove any Base Control markers, if present

### 12.3.3 Removal of a Base Control Marker

If, due to rules 10.1 or 10.2, your Base Control marker is removed from above your opponent’s Port Control marker, or if the Base Control marker is changed to your opponent’s side, or if your units leave this OZ, then the Port immediately returns to your opponent’s control


# 13 Advanced Rules

TBD
